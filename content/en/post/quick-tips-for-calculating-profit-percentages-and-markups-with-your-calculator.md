**Basic Percent Key Behavior:**
- The % key immediately calculates the percentage of the current display number
- It can do a quick combo calculation.

## III. Percent Key with Addition

**Example 1: Adding a Percentage**
> Calculate 100 + 7%

**Step-by-step process:**
1. Enter [1]{.p-1 .rounded-md .bg-gray-200} [0]{.p-1 .rounded-md .bg-gray-200} [0]{.p-1 .rounded-md .bg-gray-200}
2. Press [+]{.p-1 .rounded-md .bg-gray-200}
3. Enter [7]{.p-1 .rounded-md .bg-gray-200}
4. Press [%]{.p-1 .rounded-md .bg-gray-200}
   - Display shows: **7** (7% of 100)
5. Press [=]{.p-1 .rounded-md .bg-gray-200}
   - Final result: **107**

**What happens internally:**
- When you press %, the calculator computes 7% of the previous number (100)
- 7% of 100 = 7
- The display shows 7, but the calculator remembers: 100 + 7
- Pressing = completes the calculation: 100 + 7 = 107

## IV. Percent Key with Subtraction

**Example 2: Subtracting a Percentage**
> Calculate 100 - 7%

**Step-by-step process:**
1. Enter [1]{.p-1 .rounded-md .bg-gray-200} [0]{.p-1 .rounded-md .bg-gray-200} [0]{.p-1 .rounded-md .bg-gray-200}
2. Press [-]{.p-1 .rounded-md .bg-gray-200}
3. Enter [7]{.p-1 .rounded-md .bg-gray-200}
4. Press [%]{.p-1 .rounded-md .bg-gray-200}
   - Display shows: **7** (7% of 100)
5. Press [=]{.p-1 .rounded-md .bg-gray-200}
   - Final result: **93**

**What happens internally:**
- The % key calculates 7% of 100 = 7
- The calculator remembers: 100 - 7
- Pressing = completes: 100 - 7 = 93

## V. Practical Applications
